HOMEWORK: HOMEWORK 4.2

Now convert the mongod instance (the one in the problem 4.1 above, which uses “--dbpath 1”) to a single server replica set.
To do this, you’ll need to stop the mongod (NOT the mongo shell instance) and restart it with “--replSet” on its command line. Give the set any name you like.

Ans: type command going to directory
C:\data\replica>mongod --dbpath 1 --replSet abc --port 27001 --smallfiles --oplogSize 50

Then go to the mongo shell. Once there, run
	Ans: Run the shell with below command(connect to above instance)
	C:\Working\Suresh\Mongodb\Week4DBA\homework_4_1\replication>mongo --port 27001 --shell replication.js
	
rs.initiate()
Note: if you do not specify a configuration, the mongod will pick one based on your computer's hostname.

When you first ran homework.init(), we loaded some data into the mongod. You should see it in the replication database. You can confirm with:

use replication
db.foo.find()
Once done with that, run

homework.b()
Ans: 5002
