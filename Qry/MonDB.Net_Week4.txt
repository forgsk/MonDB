2.

.MMAPv1 automatically allocates power-of-two-sized documents when new documents are inserted
.MMAPv1 is built on top of the mmap system call that maps files into memory

3.
Which of the following are features of the WiredTiger storage engine?
Document-level concurrency
Compression

4.
Please provide the mongo shell command to add an index to a collection named students, having the index key be class, student_name. 

Neither will go in the "-1" direction..
db.students.createIndex({class:1, student_name:1})

#.
Suppose we have a collection foo that has an index created as follows: db.foo.createIndex( { a:1, b:1 } )
db.foo.insert( { a : ["apples", "oranges" ], b : "grapes" } )
db.foo.insert( { a : "grapes", b : [ 8, 9, 10 ] } )
db.foo.insert( { a : "grapes", b : "oranges" } )

#.
{
	"_id" : ObjectId("551458821b87e1799edbebc4"),
	"name" : "Eliot Horowitz",
	"work_history" : [
		{
			"company" : "DoubleClick",
			"position" : "Software Engineer"
		},
		{
			"company" : "ShopWiki",
			"position" : "Founder & CTO"
		},
		{
			"company" : "MongoDB",
			"position" : "Founder & CTO"
		}
	]
}

Type the command that you would issue in the Mongo shell to create an index on company, descending.
db.people.createIndex({"work_history.company":-1})

#.
Please provide the mongo shell command to create a unique index on student_id, class_id, ascending for the collection students.
db.students.createIndex({student_id:1, class_id:1}, {unique:true})

#.
What are the advantages of a sparse index? Check all that apply.
You can gain greater flexibility with creating Unique indexes.
The index will be smaller than it would if it were not sparse.

Notes:
======

***
to start mongod with wiredtiger option
first time -> C:\mkdir WT
C:\> mongod -dbpath WT -storageEngine wiredTiger

next time

mongod --storageEngine wiredTiger
***

Default storage engive MMAP
WiredTiger Storage Engine
document level concurrency
compression of data, of indexes

to find indexes
db.students.getIndexes();

db.students.dropIndex({student_id:1}) //same index name usedd while creating

.Sparce Index
if you create unique index on existing collection, data should be unique already. Andin case if for any attribute onwhich unique index 

is created, and if it is null for few documents it throws error. o avoid this error we create sparce index and it says to ignore the nulls Sparce index willnot be used while sorting data if there are null in the values
