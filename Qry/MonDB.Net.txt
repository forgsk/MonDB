Please provide the mongo shell command to add an index to a collection named students, having the index key be class, student_name. Neither will go in the "-1" direction..

Suppose we have a collection foo that has an index created as follows: db.foo.createIndex( { a:1, b:1 } )
db.foo.insert( { a : ["apples", "oranges" ], b : "grapes" } )
db.foo.insert( { a : "grapes", b : [ 8, 9, 10 ] } )
db.foo.insert( { a : "grapes", b : "oranges" } )

			"company" : "ShopWiki",
			"position" : "Founder & CTO"

next time

mongod --storageEngine wiredTiger
***

Default storage engive MMAP
WiredTiger Storage Engine
document level concurrency
compression of data, of indexes

to find indexes
db.students.getIndexes();

db.students.dropIndex({student_id:1}) //same index name usedd while creating
