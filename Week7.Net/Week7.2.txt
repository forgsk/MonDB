FINAL: QUESTION 2

Please use the Enron dataset you imported for the previous problem. For this question you will use the aggregation framework to figure out pairs of people 
that tend to communicate a lot. To do this, you will need to unwind the To list for each message. 

This problem is a little tricky because a recipient may appear more than once in the To list for a message. You will need to fix that in a stage of the 
aggregation before doing your grouping and counting of (sender, recipient) pairs. 


Ans:
db.messages.aggregate([
{$project: {from: "$headers.From",to: "$headers.To"}},
{$unwind: "$to"},
{$group : { _id : { _id: "$_id", from: "$from", to: "$to" }}},
{$group : { _id : { from: "$_id.from", to: "$_id.to" }, count: {$sum :1}}},
{$sort : {count:-1}},
{$limit: 2}
])

 "result" : [
         {
                 "_id" : {
                         "from" : "susan.mara@enron.com",
                         "to" : "jeff.dasovich@enron.com"
                 },
                 "count" : 750
         },
         {
                 "_id" : {
                         "from" : "soblander@carrfut.com",
                         "to" : "soblander@carrfut.com"
                 },
                 "count" : 679
         }
 ],

 "ok" : 1
